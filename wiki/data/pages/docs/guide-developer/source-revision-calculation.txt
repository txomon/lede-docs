====== Revision number calculation ====== 

LEDE continues to use the svn-like rXXXX revision, but as source code is stored in git repository, the rXXXX revision needs to be calculated separately.

LEDE uses the shell script scripts/getver.sh for calculating the revision. It calculates the revision by counting the number of commits since the LEDE repository was initially cloned from Openwrt.
  * The counting is not global, but is done separately for master and stable branches. E.g. currently 17.01 branch is at r3300 while master is at r3921.

===== Convert between source revision and git commit hash =====

You can use ./scripts/getver.sh in your buildroot in three ways:
  * Without arguments, it gives you current HEAD revision as "rxxxx-hash". That is the normal use.
  * If you give a version like "r3298" as an argument, if fetches you the git hash
  * If you give a git hash as argument, it calculates the rxxxx revision for it
