====== arm_cortex-a7_neon-vfpv4 ======

The ARM® Cortex®-A7 is the most efficient ARMv7-A processor and the most successful – it has shipped over a billion units in production. The Cortex-A7 is a 32-bit applications processor with 40-bit physical addressing and hardware virtualisation support. It features an optional integrated L2 cache that can be configured from 128KB to 1MB. The Cortex-A7 pipeline is based on an eight stage in-order design that provides significant performance improvements compared to the Cortex-A5 processor.

The Cortex-A7 is architecturally compatible with the high-performance Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A17 processors and has shipped in millions of smartphones and tablets as a LITTLE processor in ARM big.LITTLE™ configuration and also as a standalone multicore processor cluster. The Cortex-A7 is also widely shipped in other markets like wearable devices running rich operating systems, consumer embedded devices and Single Board Computers (SBCs).
