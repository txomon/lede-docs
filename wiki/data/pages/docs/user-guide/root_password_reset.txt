====== Resetting the root password ======

If you have forgotten the root password or if the root password no longer works, you have to use the [[docs:user-guide:failsafe_and_factory_reset|Failsafe Mode and Factory Reset]].

From there, you don't have to reset the whole configuration.
Note that fail safe mode does not require a password for authentication of root (!)

You only have to mount the root file system and set a new password with ''passwd'' and then trigger a restart. In fail safe mode, ''passwd'' will not ask for the old password (that you may have forgotten):
<code>
root@(none):~# mount_root
switching to jffs2 overlay
root@(none):/rom/root# passwd
Changing password for root
New password:
Retype password:
passwd: password for root changed by root
root@(none):/rom/root# reboot -f
</code>
